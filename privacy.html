            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>VoiceBeam GmbH ("we", "us", "our") operates the ImSpace mobile application and the website imspaceapp.com (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, the legal bases for processing, and your rights regarding that data.</p>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. ImSpace is designed to collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>Controller:</strong> VoiceBeam GmbH is the data controller within the meaning of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

            <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you use ImSpace, we collect and store the following data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account information</strong> &mdash; provided through Sign in with Apple (unique identifier and optional relay email address)</li>
                <li><strong>Photos you upload (may include faces)</strong> &mdash; images you choose to transform within the app (see section 5)</li>
                <li><strong>Generated images</strong> &mdash; the stylized images created through the Service (stored based on your cloud storage preference; see section 6)</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase history</strong> &mdash; records of subscriptions and credit pack purchases</li>
                <li><strong>Credit balance</strong> &mdash; your current credit count</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your real name, phone number, location data, device identifiers for advertising, contacts, or browsing history.</p>

            <h2>3. Lawful Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
            <p>We process your personal data on the following legal bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> &mdash; Processing your photos, managing your account, maintaining your credit balance, and delivering generated images are necessary to perform the contract between you and us (the Service).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR)</strong> &mdash; Retaining purchase records and invoicing data as required by German tax and commercial law.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> &mdash; Ensuring the security and stability of the Service, preventing abuse, and improving performance. Our legitimate interest is balanced against your rights and does not override them.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> &mdash; If we enable optional analytics on the website, we will obtain your consent before collecting any data. You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>Your data is used exclusively to provide and improve the ImSpace service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To process and transform your uploaded photos into stylized images</li>
                <li>To manage your credit balance and subscription status</li>
                <li>To enable you to view and download your generated images</li>
                <li>To provide customer support when requested</li>
                <li>To maintain the security and stability of the Service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose other than providing the core features of the app.</p>

            <h2>5. How We Process Photos and Face Data</h2>
            <p>When you create an image, we upload your selected source photo to our backend to run image generation. This source photo may include face data if your photo contains a person. We process images using cloud infrastructure hosted in <strong>Sweden (Azure Sweden Central)</strong>. Depending on your style and settings, your photo may be routed to different image-generation models hosted on this infrastructure.</p>
            <p>We use face data only to create the image output you requested. We do not perform face recognition, identity verification, or biometric template extraction, and we do not use your photos or generated images to train AI models.</p>
            <p>Before the first cloud generation, the app presents an explicit in-app consent step for photo/face processing and third-party AI processing. You can decline and continue using the app without starting generation.</p>

            <h2>6. Cloud Storage Toggle</h2>
            <p>Cloud storage of generated images is optional. You can control this in the app settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud storage enabled (default):</strong> Your generated images are stored securely in your cloud account so you can access them across sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud storage disabled:</strong> We do not keep a cloud copy of your generated images. You can still save results locally on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During generation, source photos and generated images are written to your cloud account so results can be delivered in-app. You can remove them at any time by deleting individual collections/images or deleting your account. If cloud backup is disabled, the app stops cloud syncing and will attempt to remove cloud-stored collections on the next connected session.</p>
            <p>Regardless of your cloud storage preference, the following data always remains stored in the cloud: your account identifier, purchase history, and credit balance.</p>

            <h2>7. Where Your Data Is Processed</h2>
            <p>Your data is processed and stored in the following regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image processing (inference):</strong> Microsoft Azure, Sweden Central (EU)</li>
                <li><strong>User records, purchase history, and cloud image storage:</strong> Google Cloud / Firebase, which may be located in the EU or North America depending on traffic and infrastructure routing</li>
                <li><strong>Website hosting:</strong> Vercel (servers may be located outside the EU; see section 12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All data is transmitted over encrypted connections using HTTPS/TLS. We follow industry-standard security practices to protect your data from unauthorized access.</p>

            <h2>8. Third-Party Processors</h2>
            <p>ImSpace uses the following third-party services as data processors or subprocessors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> &mdash; Cloud compute and inference for image generation (Sweden Central). Role: processor.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud / Firebase</strong> &mdash; Authentication (Firebase Auth), database (Firestore), cloud storage (Firebase Storage), and serverless functions (Cloud Functions). Data may be stored in the EU or North America. Role: processor.</li>
                <li><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> &mdash; Account authentication. Role: independent controller.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> &mdash; Subscription and in-app purchase management. Role: independent controller.</li>
                <li><strong>Vercel</strong> &mdash; Hosting the imspaceapp.com website. Role: processor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>VoiceBeam GmbH</strong> is the data controller. All vendors listed above that act as processors are bound by data processing agreements.</p>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal data with any other third parties. We do not sell your data. We do not use advertising networks or tracking services within the app.</p>

            <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your data for the following periods:</p>

            <h2>10. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>For clarity, ImSpace does <strong>not</strong> collect or store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
                <li>Device identifiers for advertising (IDFA)</li>

                <li>Financial or payment information (handled entirely by Apple)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Website Analytics</h2>
            <p>The ImSpace website (imspaceapp.com) may use Vercel Web Analytics to measure aggregate page views and visitor counts. This analytics service does not use cookies and does not collect personal data. No analytics or tracking is performed within the ImSpace app itself.</p>

            <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Image processing takes place within the European Union (Azure Sweden Central). Account data and cloud-stored images are hosted on Google Cloud, which may be located in the EU or North America depending on infrastructure routing.</p>
            <p>Where data is transferred outside the EU/EEA (including via Google Cloud or website hosting through Vercel), we ensure adequate protection through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission</li>
                <li>Adequacy decisions where applicable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may request details about the specific safeguards in place by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@voicebeam.de">info@voicebeam.de</a>.</p>

            <h2>13. Cookies</h2>
            <p>The ImSpace website does not use cookies for functionality. If website analytics are enabled, they operate without cookies. The ImSpace app does not use cookies.</p>

            <h2>14. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>

                <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7(3))</strong> &mdash; Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@voicebeam.de">info@voicebeam.de</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong> If you believe that our processing of your personal data violates the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.</p>

            <h2>15. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>ImSpace is not directed at children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 16. If you believe we have collected data from a child under 16, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

            <h2>16. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
