            <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>You agree to use ImSpace only for its intended purpose and not to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, or otherwise objectionable</li>

            <h2>6. Content Ownership and Usage Rights</h2>
            <h3>Your content</h3>
            <p>You retain ownership of the photos you upload to ImSpace. By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process your uploaded photos solely for the purpose of generating stylized images. This license terminates when you delete your account.</p>
            <h3>Generated images (Output)</h3>
            <p>You own your Output to the extent permitted by applicable law. You may use your Output for <strong>personal or commercial purposes</strong>, subject to the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are responsible for ensuring that your use of Output does not infringe the rights of third parties (including trademarks, publicity rights, and copyright).</li>
                <li>ImSpace does not grant you exclusive rights to any Output. Other users may generate similar or identical images.</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee that Output is unique or non-infringing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Our intellectual property</h3>
            <p>The ImSpace app, website, logo, brand, and all related content are the property of VoiceBeam GmbH. The styles, algorithms, and processing methods used by ImSpace are proprietary. We do not claim ownership of your uploaded photos or your generated Output.</p>

            <h2>7. Credits and Pricing</h2>
            <p>ImSpace uses a credit-based system for image generation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subscriptions</strong> provide monthly credits (Go, Pro, Max tiers). Subscription credits roll over to the next month but <strong>expire after two months</strong> if unused. New credits are added at the start of each billing cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit packs</strong> are one-time purchases. Credits from packs must be used <strong>within six months</strong> of purchase.</li>
                <li>Each image generation costs a specific number of credits, always displayed before creation.</li>
                <li>All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify credit costs and pricing with reasonable advance notice. Existing subscriptions will not be affected mid-cycle.</p>

            <h2>8. What Happens to Credits on Cancellation</h2>
            <p>If you cancel your subscription:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You retain access to your subscription tier until the end of your current billing period.</li>
                <li>Unused subscription credits expire at the end of your billing period (or after two months, whichever is sooner).</li>
                <li>Credits purchased through one-time credit packs remain available for six months from the date of purchase, regardless of subscription status.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Refunds</h2>
            <p>All purchases are made through the Apple App Store and are subject to Apple's refund policy. Credits that have been used cannot be refunded. If you experience technical issues preventing you from using purchased credits, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@imspace.app">hello@imspace.app</a>.</p>

            <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. If we make material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

            <h2>17. Severability</h2>
